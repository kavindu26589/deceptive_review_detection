Place the model file in this folder.

The required model can be downloaded from:
https://huggingface.co/KavinduHansaka/granite-4.0-h-tiny-gguf

After downloading, copy the model file (e.g., .gguf) into the `models/` directory
and ensure the file path is correctly referenced in the application code.

Example:
  models/
    └── granite-4.0-h-tiny.gguf
